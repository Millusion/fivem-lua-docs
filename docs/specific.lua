Citizen = {}

--- Await
--- @param promise any
--- @return void
function Citizen.Await(promise) end

--- This will “pause” the execution of the current thread for miliseconds amount of time.
--- @param miliseconds number (int)  The amount of milliseconds to pause the current thread.
--- @return void
function Citizen.Wait(miliseconds) end


--- This allows you to create a new thread. All code inside the handler will be executed asynchronously.
--- @usage This example will first print Hi, I get called first. to the console, then Hello world! once, then Can you see me? and then once every second Hello world! again. Can you see me? gets printed to the console even though the while true loop never ends, because that while true loop is inside a new thread, and won't affect the main thread of the script. It can still cause the game to freeze if you don't put a Citizen.Wait() function in a loop in a new thread, so don't forget to add that delay!
--- print("Hi, I get called first.")
--- Citizen.CreateThread(function()
---  while true do
---    print("Hello world!")
---    Citizen.Wait(1000)
---  end
--- end)
--- print("Can you see me?")
--- @param handler fun():void
--- @return void
function Citizen.CreateThread(handler) end

--- This will execute the specified function after the specified amount of miliseconds.
--- @usage This example will print This will be sent after 5 seconds. to the console after waiting for 5 seconds, meanwhile all other code around this part won't be blocked having to wait for this function to finish.
--- Citizen.SetTimeout(5000, function()
---  print("This will be sent after 5 seconds.")
--- end)
--- @param milliseconds number (int) The amount of milliseconds to pause the current thread.
--- @param callback fun():void
--- @return void
function Citizen.SetTimeout(milliseconds, callback) end

--- Outputs the passed message to any trace listeners, including the console output and the log file. Does not add a newline by itself, therefore suffix a message with "\n".
--- @usage This example will print “Hello, World!".
--- Citizen.Trace("Hello, World!\n")
--- @param message string
--- @return void
function Citizen.Trace(message) end


--- Creates a new quaternion. Quaternions are incredibly useful to represent and calculate rotations in 3D world space. Unlike the more common euler angles, quaternions are immune to gimbal lock and are therefor much more suitable for transforming rotations.
--- In FiveM's Lua runtime, quaternions are real data types, just like numbers, bools and strings are. This means that type(quat(1, 0, 0, 0)) will return quat. More about this in the Lua runtime manual.

--- Creates a new vector2 value.
--- In FiveM's Lua runtime, vectors are real data types, just like numbers, bools and strings are. This means that type(vector2(1, 2)) will return vector2. More about this in the Lua runtime manual.
--- @usage -- Basic vector with zero length:
--- vector2(0, 0)
---
--- -- Vectors are a real data type:

--- print(v - 2) -- prints `vector2(-1, 0)`
--- print(v * 2) -- prints `vector2(1, 4)`

--- 
--- -- Vectors can be normalized:

--- Creates a new vector3 value.
--- In FiveM's Lua runtime, vectors are real data types, just like numbers, bools and strings are. This means that type(vector3(1, 2, 3)) will return vector3. More about this in the Lua runtime manual.
--- Many existing natives such as GetEntityCoords and SetEntityCoords already have first class support for vector3 values. For example, GetEntityCoords returns a vector3, whereas SetEntityCoords accepts one, instead of using individual x, y, z values. See the second example below for a real world use of vector3, or read more about them in the Lua runtime manual and native functions manual.

--- @usage Since many native functions already return and support vectors in Lua, you can do the following to push your vehicle forward 5 meters relative to its own axis:
--- -- Get your vehicle's current matrix.
--- local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId())
--- local _, forwardVector, _, position = GetEntityMatrix(vehicle)

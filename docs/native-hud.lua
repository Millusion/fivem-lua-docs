--- Activates the specified frontend menu context.
--- 
--- pausemenu.xml defines some specific menu options using 'context'. Context is basically a 'condition'.
--- 
--- The `*ALL*` part of the context means that whatever is being defined, will be active when any or all of those conditions after `*ALL*` are met.
--- 
--- The `*NONE*` part of the context section means that whatever is being defined, will NOT be active if any or all of the conditions after `*NONE*` are met.
--- 
--- This basically allows you to hide certain menu sections, or things like instructional buttons.

--- In the C++ SDK, this seems not to work-- the blip isn't removed immediately. I use it for saving cars.  
--- E.g.:  
--- Ped pped = PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID();  
--- Vehicle v = PED::GET_VEHICLE_PED_IS_USING(pped);  
--- Blip b = UI::ADD_BLIP_FOR_ENTITY(v);  
--- works fine.  
--- But later attempting to delete it with:  
--- Blip b = UI::GET_BLIP_FROM_ENTITY(v);  
--- if (UI::DOES_BLIP_EXIST(b)) UI::REMOVE_BLIP(&b);  
--- doesn't work. And yes, doesn't work without the DOES_BLIP_EXIST check either. Also, if you attach multiple blips to the same thing (say, a vehicle), and that thing disappears, the blips randomly attach to other things (in my case, a vehicle).  
--- Thus for me, UI::REMOVE_BLIP(&b) only works if there's one blip, (in my case) the vehicle is marked as no longer needed, you drive away from it and it eventually despawns, AND there is only one blip attached to it. I never intentionally attach multiple blips but if the user saves the car, this adds a blip. Then if they delete it, it is supposed to remove the blip, but it doesn't. Then they can immediately save it again, causing another blip to re-appear.  
--- -------------  
--- Passing the address of the variable instead of the value works for me.  
--- e.g.  
--- int blip = UI::ADD_BLIP_FOR_ENTITY(ped);  
--- UI::REMOVE_BLIP(&blip);  
--- Remove blip will currently crash your game, just artificially remove the blip by setting the sprite to a id that is 'invisible'.

--- Not much is known so far on what it does *exactly*.
--- All I know for sure is that it draws the specified hole ID on the pause menu map as well as on the mini-map/radar. This native also seems to change some other things related to the pause menu map's behaviour, for example: you can no longer set waypoints, the pause menu map starts up in a 'zoomed in' state. This native does not need to be executed every tick.
--- 
--- You need to center the minimap manually as well as change/lock it's zoom and angle in order for it to appear correctly on the minimap.
--- You'll also need to use the `GOLF` scaleform in order to get the correct minmap border to show up.
--- 
--- Use [`N_0x35edd5b2e3ff01c0()`](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/reference.html#\_0x35EDD5B2E3FF01C0) to reset the map when you no longer want to display any golf holes (you still need to unlock zoom, position and angle of the radar manually after calling this).

--- Previously named _0xD30C50DF888D58B5, this native turns on the AI blip on the specified ped. It also disappears automatically when the ped is too far or if the ped is dead. You don't need to control it with other natives.   
--- See gtaforums.com/topic/884370-native-research-ai-blips for further information.  
--- Note: Everything said at the bottom is only valid for persistant peds, as AI blips seem to behave differently for non-persistant peds.  
--- • To create an AI blip, you must use UI::0xD30C50DF888D58B5() (_SET_PED_ENEMY_AI_BLIP). It has two arguments: "ped" which is the ped you want to AI blip to be linked to, and "showViewCones" which needs to be true for AI blips to appear.  
--- • To check if a ped has an AI blip, you can use UI::DOES_PED_HAVE_AI_BLIP(Ped ped), which returns a simple bool.  
--- • By default, AI blips never disappear. If you want them to disappear when you're at a certain distance from a ped, you can use UI::0x97C65887D4B37FA9(Ped ped, float distance) (_SET_AI_BLIP_MAX_DISTANCE)  
--- • By default, the blip only appears when you're in combat with the specified ped. If you want it to be always displayed, you can use UI::x0C4BBF625CA98C4E() (_IS_AI_BLIP_ALWAYS_SHOWN). It also has two arguments: "ped", and a flag. If the flag is set to true, the blip will always be displayed. If it's set to false, the AI blip will have its default behaviour.  
--- • By default, a view cone is displayed with the blip (basically a blue surface that represents the field of view of the ped, like in vanilla stealth missions). If you don't want it, you can disable it with UI::HIDE_SPECIAL_ABILITY_LOCKON_OPERATION(Ped ped, bool flag). If the flag is set to true, the view cone is displayed. If the flag is set to false, it is not.  
--- • Finally, there's actually 3 types of AI blips:  
--- 0 - the default, red, "enemy" blip  
--- 1 - a weird, semi-transparent, nameless, yellow blip  
--- 2 - the blue "friend" blip  
--- You can change an AI blip's type with UI::0xE52B8E7F85D39A08(Ped ped, int type) (_SET_AI_BLIP_TYPE).

--- gyazo.com/7fcb78ea3520e3dbc5b2c0c0f3712617\
--- Example:\
--- int GetHash = GET_HASH_KEY("fe_menu_version_corona_lobby");\
--- ACTIVATE_FRONTEND_MENU(GetHash, 0, -1);\
--- BOOL p1 is a toggle to define the game in pause.\
--- int p2 is unknown but -1 always works, not sure why though.\
--- \[30/03/2017] ins1de :\
--- the int p2 is actually a component variable. When the pause menu is visible, it opens the tab related to it.\
--- Example : Function.Call(Hash.ACTIVATE_FRONTEND_MENU,-1171018317, 0, 42);\
--- Result : Opens the "Online" tab without pausing the menu, with -1 it opens the map.

--- Adds a rectangular blip for the specified coordinates/area.

--- 
--- The `*NONE*` part of the context section means that whatever is being defined, will NOT be active if any or all of the conditions after `*NONE*` are met.

--- Not much is known so far on what it does *exactly*.
--- All I know for sure is that it draws the specified hole ID on the pause menu map as well as on the mini-map/radar. This native also seems to change some other things related to the pause menu map's behaviour, for example: you can no longer set waypoints, the pause menu map starts up in a 'zoomed in' state. This native does not need to be executed every tick.
--- 
--- You need to center the minimap manually as well as change/lock it's zoom and angle in order for it to appear correctly on the minimap.
--- You'll also need to use the `GOLF` scaleform in order to get the correct minmap border to show up.
--- 
--- Use [`N_0x35edd5b2e3ff01c0()`](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/reference.html#\_0x35EDD5B2E3FF01C0) to reset the map when you no longer want to display any golf holes (you still need to unlock zoom, position and angle of the radar manually after calling this).
